# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Fix: changed to 'width:100%; height:auto; max-height:340px; object-fit:contain; display:block; margin:0 auto' and added a light background + break-inside:avoid on .thumb. Now every photo is shown in full (never cropped), scaled to the column/page width, with a max-height cap so very tall crops still fit the page (letterboxed via contain).

    -message: "✅ DKA PDF EXPORT BUG FIX VERIFIED. The CSS fix for cropped photos in DKA batch PDF reports has been successfully verified. Tested the combined batch PDF export from DKA History multi-select (selected 1 batch with 4 samples). The generated report HTML (358KB) was captured from the hidden iframe and analyzed. All CSS properties are correct: object-fit:contain (NOT cover), height:auto (NOT fixed 150px), max-height:340px, display:block, margin:0 auto. No old CSS found. All 4 sample images have valid base64 data URIs. Sample photos will now display in full without cropping. No JavaScript errors during export. The bug fix is production-ready."

Root cause: the ingress proxy returns 502 after 60s; Gemini 3.1 Pro took >100s on full-res photos so POST /api/analyze never returned to the app ('Run AI Vision Analysis' failed). Fix: (1) backend downscales the image to max 1600px JPEG before sending to Gemini; (2) NEW async flow: POST /api/analyze/start returns {id,status:'running'} immediately and runs the analysis as a background task persisted in Mongo collection analyze_jobs; GET /api/analyze/jobs/{id} returns status running|done|error with record_id; (3) frontend useAnalyze now calls /analyze/start then polls every 2.5s (up to 6 min) and fetches GET /api/tests/{record_id}; stage text shows elapsed seconds. Legacy POST /api/analyze kept (sync). Verified manually via external URL: job done in ~25s."

        -comment: "User (Chrome, preview link) gets 'Upload foto gagal: Failed to fetch' immediately; not reproducible in headless Chromium (even 11MB uploads pass) → likely the user's network/proxy blocks multipart uploads. Fix: (1) NEW backend endpoints POST /api/upload/chunk {upload_id,index,total,data(base64)} and POST /api/upload/finish {upload_id,ext} → assembles and stores to object storage, returns {image_path}; stale buffers pruned after 30 min; finish on unknown id → 404. (2) frontend uploadImage: web downsizes to max 2000px via canvas, tries multipart, and on TypeError/413 falls back to 300KB base64 JSON chunks (with retry); native falls back too on network failure/413. (3) JSON POSTs have 3x retry. Verified via Playwright with /api/upload aborted at network level: chunks → analyze/start → poll → /result/{id}."
